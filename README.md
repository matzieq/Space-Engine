# Space Engine

My tiny javascript engine, made in order to better learn canvas and generally because I like to do things my way. I want to use it to make a small, simple RPG. 

If anyone wants to use it or fork it, I'm thinking about MIT license. But this will be far future - currently it's version 0.00000000000001 or thereabouts.
